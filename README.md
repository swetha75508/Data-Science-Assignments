Data Analysis & Visualization:

   • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

Machine Learning Models:

   • Regression, Classification, and Clustering techniques

   • Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning

Statistical Methods:

   • Hypothesis testing and statistical inference

SQL & Database Management:

   • Writing queries for data extraction and analysis

<br>

• Tools & Technologies:

Programming: Python (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab)

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow (basic)

Databases: MySQL

Data Visulaization: Tableu
